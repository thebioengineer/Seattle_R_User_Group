  - Given a very high level introduction to R
  - Get excited to learn more
  
- For you intermediate to advanced Folk:
  - Flex those R skills, maybe try something new
  
  - Tonight's data set can be found [github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/births/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv](http://www.github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/births/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv)
      - Come up with a visualization, and post to to Twitter, with link to your code
      - Potentially see a technique you havent


- Inspire the start of a more regular meetup schedule

# Getting Started

- Install the latest version of R onto your computer from R-project.org at: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

- To make things easier, download the RStudio IDE from Rstudio at : [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

--

- Once everything is downloaded, open RStudio
    - open a new script by either:
        - cntrl+shift+n
        - click the new script button
        
.center[![New](July_Presentation_files/New_Script.PNG)]

#Programming

- Programming is sending sets of instructions for your computer to complete
- Instructions are sent to your computer one line at a time
    - in R, a line is run by
        - either cliking the "Run" button ![Run](July_Presentation_files/run_button.PNG)
        - ctrl + enter

- You can tell R to ignore a line using the "#" symbol

```r
#This is a comment
this is not a comment and R will attempt to run it
```
   
- Comments are useful because then you can write notes to yourself
    - I suggest using them to take notes during this presentation in your new R script

# Hello World

### What in the world is an R?

- A statistical computing language, based off of S
    - R. Gentleman and R. Ihaka, 1993

- Has a large and active community

- Incredibly flexible language
    - Scripting
    - Web Applications (Shiny)
    - Reproducible Reports (Knitr)
    - Presentations
    
- This entire presentation was created using R, Rmarkdown, and the package [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)


---
# Object Oriented

- Think of an object as a box
   - it has a size and has specific contents
   - it has specific properties and behaviors
   
- Object have properties known as "class"
  - different box types
    - can have different items
    - speeds of delivery
  
  

```r
TRUE #LOGICALS (BOOLEAN) - a true or false value

1 # INTEGER - A number with no decimals

1.1 # NUMERIC - A number with the ability to have decimals 

"HELLO WORLD" #CHARACTER (STRING) - words or numbers within quotes 
```

---

# Variable Assignment

- Value assignment to variables is done through '&lt;-'

- To continue the box metaphore
    - Like writing "kitchen stuff" on a box


```r
sampleObject&lt;-TRUE #TRUE or FALSE
```

###You try
In your console, create an object named sampleObject, and assign the number 42 to it. then type 'sampleObject' into the console and press enter on your keyboard


--


```r
sampleObject&lt;-42
sampleObject
```

```
## [1] 42
```

---

# Objects in Objects

### The next object level up are
  - Vectors, Matrices and Data.frames
      - Stores multiple low level objects as one
      
  - Box Metaphore:
      - More complicated boxes, that hold the smaller boxes within them

---

##Vector

- Vectors hold other objects
  - in a single Dimension 
    - think of a skinny box that can only one line of boxes
  - Objects with in the vector are of the same type
  - created with the 'c' function


```r
VECTORS_LOGICAL&lt;-c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE) 

VECTORS_NUMERIC&lt;-c(1,2.5,3.14159267834)
VECTORS_NUMERIC_SEQUENCE&lt;-1:10

VECTORS_CHARACTER&lt;-c("THIS","is","A","Character","Vector")
```

When you print a vector, it looks like this:


```r
VECTORS_CHARACTER
```

```
## [1] "THIS"      "is"        "A"         "Character" "Vector"
```

---
##Vector

### Now You try:

Create a vector with 5 entries, assign it to sampleVector, and print it out!

.center[

```r
    name&lt;-c(...)
```
]

--

#### Example:

```r
sampleVector&lt;-c("You","can","do","this","!")
sampleVector
```

```
## [1] "You"  "can"  "do"   "this" "!"
```

---
# Objects in Objects
##Matrix
- Holds other objects in two dimensions
  - contents must all the same class as well,
  - think of an excel spread sheet or looking ar a wine rack
  ![Wine_Rack](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi1y5W6hZXcAhWbHTQIHRrtBMsQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F64-Bottle-Display-View-Wine-Rack-Kit-in-Premium-Redwood-Hand-Crafted-in-USA-%2F180837480006&amp;psig=AOvVaw0JJqBCrZJcBpV92fPawvUa&amp;ust=1531329589766218)
  

```r
MATRIX_LOGICAL&lt;-matrix(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE),ncol=2)
MATRIX_NUMERIC&lt;-matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9),ncol=3)
MATRIX_CHARACTER&lt;-matrix(c("COLUMN","ONE","HERE","THIS IS","C","2"),ncol=2)
```
---
# Objects in Objects
##Data.frame
- Continuation of the matrix idea, with added flexibility
  - contents of each column must the same class
  - Different columns can have different classes though!

```r
DATA_FRAME_MIX &lt;- data.frame(LOGICAL=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE),
                         NUMERIC=c(132.4,56.7,89),
                         CHARACTER=c("THIS","IS A","DATA.FRAME!"))
```
When you print a data.frame, it looks like this:

```r
DATA_FRAME_MIX
```

```
##   LOGICAL NUMERIC   CHARACTER
## 1    TRUE   132.4        THIS
## 2    TRUE    56.7        IS A
## 3   FALSE    89.0 DATA.FRAME!
```

---
##Vector

### Now You try:

Create a data.frame with 2 columns and 3 rows, assign it to sampleDF, and print it out!

--

#### Example:

```r
sampleDF&lt;-data.frame(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE),
                     c(123,456,789))
sampleDF
```

```
##   c.TRUE..TRUE..FALSE. c.123..456..789.
## 1                 TRUE              123
## 2                 TRUE              456
## 3                FALSE              789
```

---
# Objects in Objects

To access the data stored in these objects we use paired "square braces": [ ]

--
###Vectors
- One dimension, the entry number
    - extract using one value put into the square braces

```r
VECTORS_LOGICAL[1]
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```
---
# Objects in Objects

### Matrices and data.frames
- Two dimensions; rows and columns
    - two entries to extract them contents


```r
MATRIX_NUMERIC[1,1]
```

```
## [1] 1
```

```r
DATA_FRAME_MIX[1,1]
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---
# Objects in Objects

### Rows or Columns Extraction for Matrices

- Leaving one of the entries blank in the square braces extracts an entire row or column
- Returns a vector of the row or column


```r
MATRIX_NUMERIC[1,] #all columns of row 1
```

```
## [1] 1 4 7
```

```r
MATRIX_NUMERIC[,1] #all rows of column 1
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3
```
---
# Objects in Objects

### Rows or Columns Extraction for data.frames

- Leaving one of the entries blank in the square braces extracts an entire row or column
    - Returns a data.frame that is the subset of the row or column


```r
DATA_FRAME_MIX[1,] #all columns of row 1
```

```
##   LOGICAL NUMERIC CHARACTER
## 1    TRUE   132.4      THIS
```

```r
DATA_FRAME_MIX[,1] #all rows of column 1
```

```
## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```
---
#Objects in Objects

###Multiple Extraction
- entering a vector of the indexes into the square braces will subset the object by those indexes


```r
VECTORS_NUMERIC[2:5] #all entries 2 through 5
```


```r
MATRIX_NUMERIC[1:2,] #all columns of rows 1 and 2
MATRIX_NUMERIC[,c(1,3)] #all rows of columns 1 and 3
```


---
# Objects in Objects

### Assignment
- In addition to extraction, you can assign new values to elements of vectors, matrices and data.frames
    - specify the element(s), rows, or columns you want to replace
    - use the assignment '&lt;-' with the new values
--

You can replace a specific entry with a value

```r
VECTORS_NUMERIC[1]&lt;-45
MATRIX_NUMERIC[1,1]&lt;-9
```
--

or sections

```r
VECTORS_NUMERIC[2:4]&lt;-99
MATRIX_NUMERIC[c(1,2),c(2,3)]&lt;-20
```
---
# Objects in Objects

### Assignment
This is what the MATIX_NUMERIC looks like now we have changed it's values 


```r
print(MATRIX_NUMERIC)
```

```
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    9   20   20
## [2,]    2   20   20
## [3,]    3    6    9
```


---
# Objects in Objects

### Naming Entries

- So far we have been using indices
    - entry 1   -&gt; [1]
    - column 1  -&gt; [ ,1]
    - row 1     -&gt; [1, ]

- These objects can also have "names" to name the indices

---
# Objects in Objects

###Vectors
- Each vector entry can be named

```r
named_VECTOR_NUMERIC&lt;-c(Val1=1,Val2=2,Val3=3,Val4=4,Val5=5)
print(named_VECTOR_NUMERIC)
```

```
## Val1 Val2 Val3 Val4 Val5 
##    1    2    3    4    5
```

---
# Objects in Objects

### Data.frames

```r
named_DF_NUMERIC&lt;-data.frame(Col1=c(1,2,3),
                                 Col2=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE),
                                 Col3=c("This","Column is","Named"),
                                 row.names = c("Row1","Row2","Row3"),
                                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
print(named_DF_NUMERIC)
```

```
##      Col1  Col2      Col3
## Row1    1  TRUE      This
## Row2    2  TRUE Column is
## Row3    3 FALSE     Named
```

---
# Objects in Objects

### Named Extraction

These names can be used for identifying which entries/rows/columns to extract


```r
named_VECTOR_NUMERIC["Val4"]
```

```
## Val4 
##    4
```

```r
named_DF_NUMERIC[,"Col3"]
```

```
## [1] "This"      "Column is" "Named"
```

---
# Now You try: Extracting

Enter the following into your console:

```r
set.seed(12345)
sampleDF&lt;-data.frame(NameOne=c(1,2,3),
                     RandomValues=runif(3),
                     TestName=c("This","Column is","Named"),
                     row.names = c("Row1","test1234","Row3"))
```

1. Extract the second row of sampleDF
2. Write the number 45 to the 2nd column, 3rd row of sampleDF

---
# Now You try: Extracting

### Example:


```r
#1
sampleDF["test1234",] #sampleDF[2,]
```

```
##          NameOne RandomValues  TestName
## test1234       2    0.8757732 Column is
```

```r
#2
sampleDF[3,2]&lt;-45 #sampleDF["Row3","RandomValues"]&lt;-45
print(sampleDF)
```

```
##          NameOne RandomValues  TestName
## Row1           1    0.7209039      This
## test1234       2    0.8757732 Column is
## Row3           3   45.0000000     Named
```

# Basic Mathemetical Operations

- As with most languages,
    - Mathematical Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    - Act on the objects we give them and return a modified object
    - this is not an exhaustive list of mathematical operations built into R


```r
add &lt;- 2+2
subtract &lt;- 10-2
multiply &lt;- 2*5
divide &lt;- 20/6
```

---
# Function Junction

Mathematical operations are a special class of functions

Most functions the following format:

.center[FunctionName(argument1, argument2, ...)]

Outputs of functions need to be assigned to an output variable

Below is a basic format for a function call that takes a single input. If a function requires multiple inputs, they are separated by commas.

.center[
  outputVariable&lt;-functionName(argument1=inputVariable)
]
--

When you are trying to use a function and need to understand it better type the following into your console:


```r
?functionName
```

---
# Function Junction

Below is an example of using the 'cor' function on an input data.frame

```r
testDF&lt;-data.frame(var1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                   var2=c(4,5,6,7,8,9),
                   var3=c(11,9,7,5,3,1))

corr_matrix&lt;-cor(testDF)

corr_matrix
```

```
##      var1 var2 var3
## var1    1    1   -1
## var2    1    1   -1
## var3   -1   -1    1
```

---
# Function Junction

- Sometimes functions have multiple arguments, but you only need to input one or two of them to get them to run
    - Additional arguments are for changing how the function runs. 
    
--


- The order in which you enter the input variables is the argument it will be assigned to unless you assign the argument in the function via '=':

    - function(functionArgument1=input1, functionArgument2=input2)
    
    
---
# Function Junction

- For example, the cor function, if you type '?cor' shows that it has the arguments for
    - x, y, use, and method

- x is the only argument without a default value, and thus needs to be defined to run

- By default, the method used is Pearson, but in order to change it to 'Spearman'
    - you need to add 'spearman' as an input to cor
    - use argument assignment (argumentName=input)

.center[

```r
spearman_corr&lt;-cor(testDF,method='spearman')
```
]
        

---

# Now You try: Functions

Enter the following into your console:

```r
set.seed(12345)
sampleDF&lt;-data.frame(c(1,2,3),
                     runif(3),
                     c(1.1,2.2,5.5))
```

- Use the 'cov' function to calculate the covariance of sampleDF using the Kendall method
    - pro-tip: use the '?cov', and compare it to this use of 'cor':
    
.center[

```r
  corr_matrix&lt;-cor(testDF)
```
]

---
# Now You try: Functions

### Example:


```r
cov(sampleDF, method="kendall")
```

```
##                  c.1..2..3. runif.3. c.1.1..2.2..5.5.
## c.1..2..3.                6        2                6
## runif.3.                  2        6                2
## c.1.1..2.2..5.5.          6        2                6
```

# Control Structures

- Make decisions based on looking at variables values and check if they meet certain conditions
    - if/else if/else
    - for
    - while
--

- Each structure has a specific use case:
--
  
  - if/else if/else
      - run certain chunks of code based on certain conditions
--

  - for
      - for every value input, run a chunk of code
--

  - while
      - while this condition is met, run the chunk of code until it is not
---

# Control Structures

### if/else if/else
- will run certain chunks of code based on whether variables specified meet certain conditions
- can connect as many or as little 'else if'/'else' to the initial 'if' as necessary to spell out all conditions
  - will only run first chunk that is true


```r
controlVariable&lt;-5

if(controlVariable&lt;5){
  #  run if controlVariable is less than 5
  print("Less than 5")
  
}else if(controlVariable&gt;5){
  #  run if controlVariable is greater than than 5
  print("Greater than 5")
  
}else{
  #  run if previous two conditions are not met
  print("Exactly 5")
}
```

---
# Control Structures

### for
- will repeatedly run certain chunk of code for each of the input conditions
- good for when you know the number of times your code needs to run


```r
for(inputVar in 1:10){
  print(inputVar)
}
```

---
# Control Structures

### while
- will repeatedly run certain chunk of code until the condition is false
- good for when you do not the number of times your code needs to run


```r
inputVar&lt;-10

while(inputVar&gt;0 ){
  print(inputVar)
  inputVar&lt;-inputVar-1
}
```


.footnote[ while loops sound nice, but be careful, it will run forever if the control condition is always true. this is called an infinite loop!]

---
# Control Structures

### Control use case

- For example, you wanted to get the total sum of each row in your data.frame. You could do something like this:


```r
dataFrameExample&lt;-data.frame(Col1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                             Col2=c(7,8,9,10,11,12))

dataFrameSums&lt;-c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)

dataFrameSums[1]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[1,])

## Now I copy and paste the above code for each row
dataFrameSums[2]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[1,])
dataFrameSums[3]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[2,])
dataFrameSums[4]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[3,])
dataFrameSums[5]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[5,])
dataFrameSums[6]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[6,])

dataFrameSums
```

```
## [1]  8  8 10 12 16 18
```

---

# Control Structures - Danger of Copy and Paste



```r
dataFrameSums[1]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[1,])

## Now I copy and paste the above code for each row
*dataFrameSums[2]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[1,])
*dataFrameSums[3]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[2,])
*dataFrameSums[4]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[3,])
dataFrameSums[5]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[5,])
dataFrameSums[6]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[6,])
```

---

# Now You try: Control Structures

Enter the following into your console:


```r
dataFrameExample&lt;-data.frame(Col1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                             Col2=c(7,8,9,10,11,12))

dataFrameSums&lt;-c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)
```

calculate the sum of each row of dataFrameExample using control structures and the 'sum' function. Write it to the dataFrameSums vector.
    

---
# Now You try: Control Structures
##Use the For(ce), Luke

### Example:


```r
dataFrameExample&lt;-data.frame(Col1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                             Col2=c(7,8,9,10,11,12))
dataFrameSums&lt;-c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)

#dataFrameSums[1]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[1,])

for(rowinDF in c(1:6)){
  dataFrameSums[rowinDF]&lt;-sum(dataFrameExample[rowinDF,])
}

dataFrameSums
```

```
## [1]  8 10 12 14 16 18
```

##Congratulations, we have now covered most of what you need to know for basic data manipulations. We are now going to get into how you get your data into/outof R, extending R, and finally how you can visualize your data and analysis!

---

# Data Import

- Data manipulation is great, but only if you have data to work on
  
- Good thing is a family of functions are written to import data into R!
    - base R has "read.table","read.csv","read.tsv",...
    - these functions will read and convert the data into a data.frame
    - outputs must be assigned to a variable

- All of these require the path to the file you will be reading in as a character
    - for example, you had a csv file in C:\\Users\ellis\temporaryfolder\examplefile.csv
--
    
    - the call to read the file in would be as follows:
    

```r
example&lt;-read.csv(
  file = "C://Users/ellis/temporaryfolder/examplefile.csv",
  header = TRUE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

---
# Data Export

- complementary versions of "read" functions
    -ie. write.table, write.csv, ...
        - first argument input is the object to write
        - second is the path to save to
        
        - warning: it will overwrite files without warning!
  
- In addition, R has it's own file format called RDS
    - saving function is saveRDS
    - reading function is readRDS
    - Benefits:
        - Compactly save objects to disk
        - Quickly read objects from disk
    

```r
testDF&lt;-data.frame(var1=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                   var2=c(4,5,6,7,8,9),
                   var3=c(11,9,7,5,3,1))
write.csv(testDF, "C://Users/ellis/temporaryfolder/exampleSavedfile.csv")
saveRDS(testDF, "C://Users/ellis/temporaryfolder/exampleSavedfile.RDS")
```

# The CRAN and Packages

Functions I've shown are built into R, as in they are available from the time R is downloaded. Sometimes more advanced techniques are required.

There are two options
  
  - a) create entire code sets and programs for complex algorithms, have to debug when new versions of R come out, ensure consistency, spend time making sure function works as it should than using it
  
  - b) copy someones code

R has something called the "Comprehensive R Archive Network" (CRAN) where very smart people that enjoy writing out very useful functions and then putting them online where they are available for everyone. The way you get to that is actually pretty straight-forward too!

More than likely, someone has created a package to do whatever you are trying to do. Take a quick google search to see if it does.   - The CRAN has over 12649 at of June 25th, and grows every day.

---

# The CRAN and Packages

- R was built to be extensible by default and read libraries from the CRAN
- install.packages

- downloads and installs necessary code for immediate use
--

- to use non-base R functions
  - library()


```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

---

#Visualization

- R has graphic generation abilities built in, but a large number of people in the community rely on the package "ggplot2"
- There are arguments for both in terms of control and final product quality
    - in the end, it is whichever makes the most sense to you
    

```r
plot(data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                y=c(4,5,6,7,8,9)))
lines(x=c(1,2,3,4,5,5,6),y=c(5,7,8,9,7,6,6),col="red")
```


```r
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+
  geom_point(
    data=data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                  y=c(4,5,6,7,8,9)),
    aes(x=x,y=y)+
  geom_line(
    data=data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                  y=c(5,7,8,9,7,6,6)),
    aes(x=x,y=y,color='Red'))
```

#Visualization

###ggplot2

- Most of my graphics generation has been in ggplot2
- The nice features of ggplot2 include
    - layers graphics
    - obvious which layers are on top
    - easily add to ggplot to create different versions
    - abstracts some of the less fun parts of graphic generation
    - many geoms and scaling for logically generating your graphic

--

- install ggplot2 with install.packages("ggplot2")
- load into environment with library(ggplot2)

---
#Visualization

###ggplot2

- all plots start with "ggplot"

```r
gg&lt;-ggplot()

OR

gg&lt;-ggplot(data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                  y=c(4,5,6,7,8,9)))
```
---
#Visualization

###ggplot2

- add layers with '+'

- layers are "geoms"
    - how to plot the information 
    - geom_point, geom_line, geom_path, geom_boxplot, geom_bar, geom_hist
    
- each geom uses the function "aes", which tell the layers what columns of the input data to use to plot
    - inputs to aes change based on the geom
    - to know what to use, type ?geom_XXX and read about its aethetics


```r
gg&lt;-ggplot(data.frame(Col_X=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                  Col_Y=c(4,5,6,7,8,9)))+
  geom_point(aes(x=Col_X,y=Col_Y))
```

#Visualization

###ggplot2

- titles and labels can be added via ggtitle, xlab, ylab

- Can be modified with "themes" as well
    - ggplot2 comes with themes such as
        - theme_bw, theme_minimal, etx
    - there are packages that have additional themes
        - "ggthemes" is one example
    - theme function allows you to create your own themes



```r
gg&lt;-ggplot(data.frame(Col_X=c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
                  Col_Y=c(4,5,6,7,8,9)))+
  geom_point(aes(x=Col_X,y=Col_Y))+
  ggtitle("This is the Title")+
  xlab("Sample X Label")+
  ylab("Sample Y Label")+
  theme_minimal()
```

This has been a crash course to hopefully give you some tools to start understanding how to read and write your own R code and start visualizing data. 

The R world is massive, and there is always something new to learn. I will now go though an analysis and visualization of the data set I shared earlier.

# Tonights  Data Set!


```r
# read.csv reads in the csv file from our computer
# we tell it that the file has a "header", and
# to make all values that are not numeric, characters
usBirths&lt;-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/births/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv",
                   header = TRUE,
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

# Tonights Data Set

### TidyVerse &amp; TidyData
- Family of packages and family built to
    - facilitate ease of use
    - readability
    
- The core is the "pipe"-ing function
    - %&gt;%
    - from the 'magrittr' package
    
- the pipe sends the output of the function to the next function
    - either to:
        - the first argument
        - use "." to specify which argument to send the output to

# Tonights Data Set - Analysis Time

We will now start the actual analysis

First, a hypothesis: There are more births at the end of the month.

Generate summary statistics to confirm hypothesis


```r
usBirths_day&lt;-usBirths%&gt;%
  group_by(date_of_month)%&gt;%
  summarise(BirthAverage=mean(births),
            BirthMin=min(births),
            BirthMax=max(births))
```
---

# Tonights Data Set - Analysis Time


```r
head(usBirths_day,n=5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 4
##   date_of_month BirthAverage BirthMin BirthMax
##           &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1             1       11131.     6629    14627

# Tonights Data Set - Analysis Time

- Numbers are hard to visualize immediately
- a box plot will show me the mean and ranges of all the dates easily



```r
ggplot(usBirths)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=factor(date_of_month),y=births))+
  ggtitle("Births by Date in Month")+
  xlab("Date")+
  ylab("Births")
```

# Tonights Data Set 

##Takeaways
- It looks like there are more births on the 1st than the end of the month
- Big drop in births on the 13th

##Weaknesses
  - only accounted for actual day in month, not normalized for length of the month

##Future
- look at week vs weekday
- when in the year vs date
- year over year trends
